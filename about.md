# About Me

![Profile picture](assets/images/profile.jpg){:style="width:200px;border-radius:50%;"}

I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory**, **simulation**, and **real-world applications**.  
Some things about me:

- 🎓 MSc Applied Physics – TU Eindhoven
- 🌊 Research on **ocean wave prediction** (Kalman filtering, HOS methods)
- 🧑‍💻 Strong in **Python**, **MATLAB**, **C**, and **LaTeX**
- 🌏 Research visits: **UC Berkeley** and planned **Tsinghua University**

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, sailing, and Japanese language learning.
