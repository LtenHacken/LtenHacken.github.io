## Profile
I’m a MSc student in Applied Physics at Eindhoven University of Technology, pursuing the track Fluids, Bio- and Softmatter. I am passionate about **fluid dynamics**, **soft matter physics** and **computational physics**. Currently I am located in the United States for a six month appointment as visiting researcher at the Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (taflab.berkeley.edu) of the University of California, Berkeley, working on a project in ocean wave reconstruction and prediction. In November, I return to the Netherlands to start my graduation project in collaboration with Tsinghua University, where I will conduct reasearch from February to May, in icing under complex conditions. My main interests are computational fluid dynamics, soft matter and active matter physics. 

During my academic carreer I have developed proficiency in a multitude of programming languages and frameworks aimed at scientific computing, engineering and artificial intelligence. I consider myself well experienced in Python, having done projects involving object-oriented programming and writing modules. Besides Python, I have worked on projects in Matlab involving control and simulation and have Mathematica 

Two projects I'd like to highlight are:

- Ocean wave reconstruction and prediction using the Higher Order Spectral (HOS) method and Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF). Supported bij a €2.500 grant: Link To Report

- High Performance Computing (HPC) implementation of the Lattice Boltmann method in C using OpenACC: Link to Summary + Results preview

Besides my academic carreer, I have been active in a multitude of organisations to broaden my horizon and develop myself both personally and professionaly. From these experiences I would like to highlight: 

- A year as full time president of JE Netherlands (UniPartners Nederland), where I was ultimately responsible for the national board and twelve local offices invloving 300+ students/consultants, € 800k turnover and 250+ projects. 

- My role as trainer and speaker at De AI Workshop, where I lead hands-on workshops on artificial intelligence and it's implementation for a wide range of audiences. 

- Selected as delegate for the Netherlands Asia Honors Summer School, a prestigious programme in Hong Kong and Ho Chi Minh City for the 70 best applicants across Dutch universities. The curriculum focussed on contemporary relations between East Asia and the West.
